# D3D9-Alpha-Blending-and-Transform
Just a simple project to test my knowledge on alpha blending and matrix transformations.

# How to run and compile
Open the project in Visual Studio 2019 and compile. The default settings should be enough to run this project.

Note: If you try to run directly from the executable you will need to add the Assets folder (with the Textures folder in it) on the same directory as the executable.

# Known issues
You may see some weird white lines on the shadow.
