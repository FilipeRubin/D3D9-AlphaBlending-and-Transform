# D3D9 alpha blending and transform
Just a simple project to test my knowledge on alpha blending and matrix transformations.

# How to run and compile
Open the project in Visual Studio 2019 and compile. The default settings should be enough to run this project.

#### Notes:
- If you try to run directly from the executable (after compiling) you will need to add the Assets folder (with the Textures folder in it) to the same directory as the executable.
- You may only compile in x86 depending on your system.
- If you're using an older version of Visual Studio, make sure to select the available Windows SDK and Toolset versions on project properties.
- Also make sure to select all of the .cpp and .h files and set "Included in Project" to True.
